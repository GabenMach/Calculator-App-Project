# Calculator-App-Project

Small project for a course, to use the file click Clone or Download, extract the files and open calc.html or simply access the web app: https://gabenmach.github.io/Calculator-App-Project/

I wrote calc.js and modified calc.html to complete the requirements. If you get NaN just click the C button.
